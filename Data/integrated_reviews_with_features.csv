"First there was Frosted Mini-Wheats, in original size, then there was Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size.

"Previously, I've attempted a recipe with white rice noodles and overcooked them, which made them soggy. So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.",previously attempted recipe white rice noodle overcooked made soggy determined overcook brown rice noodle tried making two dish first miso soup brown rice noodle really broth miso green onion noodle added hot noodle softened puffed think softened water maybe rinsed first broth ended little starchy noodle pretty good br br noodle really flavor take flavor whatever dish rice noodle miso probably best idea mild miso flavor really give noodle much flavor also tried stir frying noodle much better soaked noodle hot water minute drained came clear kind crunchy stir fried garlic onion salt coconut oil also added vinegar nama shoyu flavor noodle came crunchy spicy actually pretty good br br nice thing noodle need minute warm water fried added soup dish fairly versatile also gluten free brown rice noodle seem firm white rice noodle another reviewer posted look like noodle made singapore,NEGATIVE,0.8040005564689636,5,"['overcook brown rice noodle', 'really broth miso', 'green onion noodle', 'added hot noodle', 'first broth', 'little starchy noodle', 'flavor', 'whatever dish rice noodle miso', 'mild miso flavor', 'noodle', 'much flavor', 'frying noodle', 'much better soaked noodle hot water minute', 'fried garlic onion salt coconut oil', 'vinegar nama shoyu flavor noodle', 'crunchy spicy', 'actually pretty good br br nice thing noodle', 'added soup dish', 'free brown rice noodle', 'firm white rice', 'another reviewer', 'noodle', 'singapore']"

I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)).

"After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3-yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

"I recently bought some of this at a local market.  I decided to try it because for quite some time now I have purchased Morton's Light Salt to cut down on the some of the sodium I take in.  This Diamond Crystal blend is not only cheaper than the Morton's for a generous amount more, but it also taste better in my opinion.  Like the Morton's, it contains a full one third less sodium.  But where the Morton's uses the popular substitute Potassium Chloride that has a slight metallic taste to it, the main substitute ingredient in this Diamond Chrystal blend is Silicon Dioxide, which to me has a much more natural salt taste.  I prefer it over the potassium chloride, and as already mentioned, you get more for your money with this blend making it a sure deal. It took me no time at all to get used to it, and I use it in my cooking as well as in the shaker as well.

"I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS.

"I very much enjoy dark roasts.  The challenge I find is that many of them are either burnt or overly bitter from poor roasting.  This coffee does a very good job of being a strong dark roast that is full of flavor without any hint of burnt or bitter flavors.

Last time I ate ramen was when I was a 16 yrs old and even then I didn't care for them much (but in a pinch was a quick meal). I bought a whole bunch of noodles for my nephew who is in college and seeing the prices these were going for I HAD to try them myself.  I prepared it as instructed in the packaging. Only difference is I only used half of the seasonings packet. I always found seasoning packets too salty for my taste ( I also never drink the left over broth saves both calories and sodium) . I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well.

"With hundreds (if not thousands) of coffee brands and/or types, it's tough to choose one, especially online without tasting.  I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store.

Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me.

"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired).

Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.

"I've never had Finn Crisp (any flavor) or other crispbreads before. Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like.

"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.

Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.

":: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia.

I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product.

"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",variety pack came u amazon vine program sample two cat living various high end dry cat food time e g grain food chicken tuna salmon version fancy pantsy duck l orange stuff local pet shop partial canned food often gone canned food route less convenient seem worth candle since seem favor dry food mouse bird whatever else glean little acre wood typically start loving canned food bite rest sits bowl dry toss go back dry food grown love br br however cat smitten stuff look like real food large chunk fish seafood thickened broth strong fishy smell canned food look like something could almost tempted eat self pinch 3 ounce size make perfect treat cat feeding dry food leave nothing behind dump dish added hot water really love broth br br sure want cat eating stuff reason want eight year old eating fast food franchise much might love food snarf flash concerned food may healthy thing animal eating planet seeing made thailand emblazoned box made immediately wonder whether stuff might include ingredient banned u could otherwise manufactured without adequate regulation method material chinese pet food fiasco certainly came mind br br discussion reviewer menadione used product confirms concern also left wonder source fish seafood can farm raised thailand condition wild fish may subject overfishing least ought feeding hungry humanity rather going cat gullet mercury contaminant food br br bottom line cat seem love stuff sure sufficient convince buy,NEGATIVE,0.9933045506477356,6,"['variety pack', 'u amazon vine program sample two cat', 'various high end dry cat food time e g grain food chicken tuna salmon version fancy pantsy duck l orange stuff local pet shop partial canned food', 'canned food route', 'worth candle', 'favor dry food mouse bird', 'whatever', 'little acre wood', 'canned food bite rest', 'bowl dry toss', 'dry food grown love br br', 'cat', 'stuff', 'real food large chunk fish seafood', 'something', 'self pinch 3 ounce size', 'perfect treat cat', 'dry food', 'nothing', 'dump dish', 'added hot water', 'broth br br', 'cat', 'stuff reason', 'eight year old eating fast food franchise', 'food snarf flash', 'concerned food', 'thailand', 'emblazoned box', 'stuff', 'ingredient banned u', 'adequate regulation method material', 'chinese pet food fiasco', 'mind br br discussion reviewer menadione used product', 'concern', 'wonder source fish seafood', 'thailand condition', 'wild fish', 'hungry humanity', 'cat gullet mercury contaminant food br br bottom line cat', 'love stuff', 'sufficient convince']"

When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.

"I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this.",pondered buying product day mixed review many concerning size ginger feel people got scrap 24 pack received pretty uniform cube good size hand best crystallized ginger ever except home made hong kong br br first chunk right size tender sweet without large enjoy snack quality ginger outstanding deep fresh flavor right amount sugar color light gold texture lack fibrous strand mature ginger much crystallized ginger made say baby ginger attest must flavor strong without overpowering heat heat place mild end ginger spectrum work want fire one two crystallized ginger recommend fiery one reed better overall flavor ginger br br definitely ginger snacking want bake could definitely need get busy knife work looking dried ginger either fresh tender sweet heat ginger tea could see mashing cube two making something pretty terrific probably end eating straight gong buy baking cut small nugget ginger snap using ginger going amazing br br bottom line possible people received bad package small piece 24 pack saw minimal variation size nothing describe large small fresh hell sugared quality ginger world like ginger find hard imagine falling love,POSITIVE,0.736519992351532,-1,"['buying product day mixed review', 'size ginger', 'people', '24 pack', 'pretty uniform cube good size hand', 'best crystallized ginger', 'home', 'hong kong br br', 'right size tender', 'large enjoy snack quality ginger', 'right amount sugar color light gold texture', 'fibrous strand mature ginger much crystallized ginger', 'baby ginger attest', 'heat heat place', 'mild end ginger spectrum work', 'fire', 'one two crystallized ginger', 'fiery', 'overall flavor ginger br br', 'bake', 'busy knife work', 'dried ginger', 'either fresh tender sweet heat ginger tea', 'cube', 'something', 'straight gong', 'cut small nugget ginger snap', 'ginger', 'amazing br br bottom line possible people', 'bad package small piece 24 pack', 'minimal variation size nothing', 'large small fresh hell sugared quality ginger world', 'ginger', 'falling love']"

"You know, it's been a while since I've had a nutritional shake or protein drink.  When I took a fitness course in college I tried a whole bunch of different kinds... which all tasted like chalk to me. I would hold my breath and try not to gag or throw up. So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a ""shake"" and not a ""protein drink"" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with ""bearable"".

"Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.

They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.

A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more.

"My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy.

"[...] I took it out of the box rinsed the package kneaded as directed and ate it straight out of the package.

Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.

"Once upon a time, I used cheap rice for dishes.  Over time, I have discovered that there are preferable products.  This Jasmati long grain American jasmine rice exemplifies. It is one of a series of rices produced  by Rice Select.<br /><br />It has a nice texture and a nice taste once you prepare it.

As I pour my stir fry over the fried rice, a delicious meal (well, normally) results. But a good rice base is necessary for a successful stir fry.  That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.

"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.

"Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency.

"First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier.

"I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense.

"I haven't had soda or carbonation in years. I got this for my parents who, to avoid sugar, drink nothing but aspartame filled fresca black cherry and peach.

"My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.

"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand.

"*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.

This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.

"Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the ""bad stuff"" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality.

(For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips.

"When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation.

"Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( ½ teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your ½ teaspoon squeeze (or carry a ½ teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others.

"Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with ¾ tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.",lipton yellow label ctc crush tear curl processed black indian tea lipton make uk india market folk take tea milk sugar ctc tea look little like coarse coffee ground brew quickly dark robust liquor stand milk sugar tea drinker say process gain heartiness cost subtlety perfume br ctc make stronger brew leaf tea e tea bag start ¾ tsp yellow label per cup steep three minute adjust taste next time find second extraction six minute steep quite drinkable matter taste br settled yellow label daily cuppa trying several kind leaf tea year also tried tetley another ctc blend found one dimensional heavy single estate leaf tea still delight inner tea snob cost make occasional treat daily tipple br scale value money yellow label clear winner know tea price range taste good yes find tea offer complexity subtlety bouquet lot money br looking daily cuppa delivers real tea satisfaction penny cup hard go wrong yellow label start one lb box 11 two two lb box 35 even better value year worth tea house,NEGATIVE,0.9840413331985474,1,"['lipton yellow label ctc crush tear curl', 'uk india market folk', 'tea milk sugar ctc tea look', 'coarse coffee ground', 'milk sugar tea drinker', 'process', 'heartiness cost subtlety perfume br ctc', 'stronger brew leaf tea e tea bag', 'yellow label', 'cup', 'steep three minute adjust taste', 'second extraction', 'six minute steep quite drinkable matter taste', 'br', 'yellow label daily cuppa', 'several kind leaf tea year', 'another ctc blend', 'one dimensional heavy single estate leaf tea', 'inner tea snob cost', 'occasional treat daily tipple br scale value money yellow label clear winner', 'tea price range', 'tea offer complexity subtlety bouquet lot money', 'daily cuppa', 'real tea satisfaction penny cup', 'wrong yellow label', 'one lb box', '11 two two lb box']"

The little pieces of nuts that are embedded in each O are hardly noticeable, both visually and in terms of the overall taste. It turns out that these are technically speaking not really nuts, but rather peanuts. They mostly have an effect in terms of the overall flavor - the combination of corn/oats and peanut pieces is probably responsible for the peanut-buttery taste. The Os are indeed very crunchy, and they are among the crunchiest cereals that I have ever tried. They don't lose this crunchiness easily even after a minute or two of soaking in milk.

"I was buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE"">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to.

"I have to LOL a bit at the ""How do you rate this item?"" question for this review.  How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.

"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

"***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out.

"I'm not a great cook, so we wind up eating a lot of burgers and fries in our house. Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.<br /><br />I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly ""plastic"" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:<br /><br />The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as ""plastic""-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion.

"When you buy Natural Balance (Dick Van Patten's Brand from ""Eight is Enough"" -- who knew) you will discover that you are paying more than your regular Friskies, 9-Lives or regular store available brands.  In fact, sometimes this brand is hard to find ... but it's worth every penny.<br /><br />Our cats enjoy a mixture of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008VKBEQ"">Wellness Healthy Weight Formula Dry Cat Food</a> and Natural Balance wet food.  I use the Indoor formula because they are indoor cats.  Our cats love this formula and chow it down like happy campers.  Their fur is soft as can be, their eyes are bright and they are in great health.<br /><br />You need to understand that in the world of cat food like so many other things, you really get what you pay for.  You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of ""corn meal"" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.<br /><br />Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is ""corn meal"" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.<br /><br />With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat ""poop"" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.  Put good stuff in your cat, get more pleasant outcomes :)<br /><br />I've lived it and learned it.  We are a 5 cat household with ONE litterbox and do amazingly fine.  I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIP9Y"">Nature's Logic Ponderosa Pine Cat Litter</a> and this keeps odors to an absolute minumum.  Some people wonder if we have cats!

"****<br /><br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****",br br tazo wild sweet orange herbal infusion nice orange herbal tea contains lemongrass blackberry leaf citric acid rose hip spearmint leaf natural flavor orange peel safflower hibiscus flower rose petal natural orange essence ginger root licorice root sweet fruity subtle wonderful tea enjoy orangey tea br br tazo interesting company make super premium tea socially responsible based portland motto reincarnation tea tazo owned starbucks web site fun quirky zen type focus definitely worth checking unclear though web site many ingredient organic kosher use natural flavor tea wording seems little vague super premium tea br br paper tea packet tazo writes lively blend sweet citrus herb orange essence sweet yet tart cup liquid sunshine radiating multi layered orange flavor exotic hint spice distinctive floral finish wild indeed web site tazo describes flavor profile wild sweet orange tart sweet smooth licorice tazo describes aroma orange rose lime pretty accurate although word give hope taste tea never quite approach br br would rate tea tazo general good better premium tea like stash celestial seasoning good numi soooooo spoiled numi tea tazo wild sweet orange get four star br br,POSITIVE,0.9956735968589783,1,"['br br', 'wild sweet orange herbal infusion', 'nice orange herbal tea', 'lemongrass blackberry leaf citric acid', 'hip spearmint leaf natural flavor orange peel safflower hibiscus flower', 'petal natural orange essence ginger root licorice root sweet fruity subtle wonderful tea enjoy orangey tea br br', 'super premium tea', 'tea tazo owned starbucks web site', 'web site', 'many ingredient', 'natural flavor tea wording', 'little vague super premium tea br br paper tea packet tazo', 'sweet citrus herb orange essence', 'sweet yet tart cup liquid sunshine', 'multi layered orange flavor exotic hint spice distinctive floral finish', 'wild indeed web site tazo', 'flavor profile', 'wild sweet orange tart sweet smooth licorice tazo', 'aroma orange', 'rose lime', 'word', 'hope taste tea', 'br br', 'tea tazo general good better premium tea', 'stash celestial', 'good numi soooooo', 'numi tea tazo', 'four star br']"

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.

"This has quickly become a staple in our home! It has a pleasant nutty taste that is nice plain or seasoned and works well with a lot of other foods. It doesn't need to be rinsed and cooks up easily in the rice cooker.<br /><br />I love that I can get it started with one hand in less than a minute with a baby on my hip! One time when I made it, I measured out the whole package with my rice cooker cup (3.5 rice cooker cups) and added twice as much water (7 rice cooker cups). I took note of the water level in the rice cooker bowl (right at my ""Sweet 6"" line). So now I can just dump the pouch in the bowl, fill with water up to the Sweet 6 line, set it to the brown rice setting, and start. That's it! My rice cooker brown rice setting takes 1 hr 45 minutes. I start it early in the day and the rice cooker keeps it warm until I'm ready for it. It always comes out light and fluffy. I have not tried it with the quick rice setting or on the stove-top, so I'm honestly not sure if there is any difference in taste or texture between the methods.<br /><br />I make an entire package once or twice a week. My family of 5 eats about 1/3 of it the first night and we finish it as leftovers over the next few days. One of my favorite ways to serve it is as quinoa salad, which I make with cold (leftover) quinoa, tomato, cucumber, maybe some onions, avocado and/or bell peppers, feta and some red wine vinaigrette. The texture of the quinoa goes well with the salad, and it soaks up the vinaigrette and takes on the taste. It is really a delight.<br /><br />The price with Subscribe & Save is great, especially considering that it is organic and fair trade, and doesn't need to be rinsed.",quickly become staple home pleasant nutty taste nice plain seasoned work well lot food need rinsed cook easily rice cooker br br love get started one hand less minute baby hip one time made measured whole package rice cooker cup 3 5 rice cooker cup added twice much water 7 rice cooker cup took note water level rice cooker bowl right sweet 6 line dump pouch bowl fill water sweet 6 line set brown rice setting start rice cooker brown rice setting take 1 hr 45 minute start early day rice cooker keep warm ready always come light fluffy tried quick rice setting stove top honestly sure difference taste texture method br br make entire package twice week family 5 eats 1 3 first night finish leftover next day one favorite way serve quinoa salad make cold leftover quinoa tomato cucumber maybe onion avocado bell pepper feta red wine vinaigrette texture quinoa go well salad soak vinaigrette take taste really delight br br price subscribe save great especially considering organic fair trade need rinsed,POSITIVE,0.9739047884941101,5,"['nice plain seasoned work', 'easily rice cooker br br love', 'baby hip', 'measured whole package rice cooker cup 3 5 rice cooker cup', 'twice much water 7 rice cooker cup', 'note water level rice cooker bowl', 'right sweet 6 line dump pouch bowl fill', 'water sweet 6 line set brown rice', 'start rice cooker brown rice setting', '1 hr', '45 minute start', 'early day rice cooker', 'light fluffy', 'stove top', 'honestly sure difference taste texture method br br', 'entire package', 'twice week family', 'quinoa salad', 'cold leftover quinoa tomato cucumber', 'well salad soak vinaigrette take taste', 'organic fair trade need']"

"OK, so it isn't exactly as good as grilled cheese, but melting a slice of cheese on one of these crispy discs in the microwave is close enough for me, plus no need for fattening butter.

They offer a multitude of options for quick GF meals, perfect for someone like me who typically eats several 1-course small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large multi-course ones.  The taste is very mild, relying on whatever you put on them to add 95% of the flavor.

"The ONLY reason I give ZATARAIN'S NEW ORLEANS STYLE JAMBALAYA MIX, 8-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 12), four stars instead of 5 is because one must buy 12 boxes together, here on Amazon.

"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.

Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.

"When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.

"I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.

Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog ""Swiderski,"" and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!

What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.",tried brand vco keep coming back nutiva well blended smooth flavor best tried love use kind cooking especially good cooking bitter green like turnip collard coconut taste help cut bitterness giving marvelous flavor green br br discovered fantastic way make healthy popcorn using vco tried stovetop method past using olive oil always burned pot put great heaping tablespoon vco 10 quart fagor canning pot melt 390 induction burner dump popcorn kernel cover bottom single layer put glass lid fit pot follow popping process jiggling pot little keep unpopped kernel falling bottom kernel pop listen popping slow like microwave popcorn turn induction burner let pot sit minute last kernel pop make wonderfully vco coated popcorn enjoyed without salt necessary add little fine popcorn salt toss,POSITIVE,0.8662203550338745,17,"['brand vco', 'smooth flavor', 'love use', 'especially good cooking bitter green', 'turnip', 'collard coconut taste help', 'bitterness', 'marvelous flavor', 'green br br', 'healthy popcorn', 'vco tried stovetop method', 'olive oil', 'pot', 'heaping tablespoon vco', '10 quart fagor canning pot', '390 induction burner dump popcorn kernel', 'bottom single layer', 'glass', 'lid fit pot follow popping process', 'jiggling pot', 'unpopped kernel', 'falling bottom kernel pop', 'microwave popcorn', 'induction burner', 'pot', 'last kernel pop', 'vco coated popcorn', 'salt', 'little fine popcorn salt']"

"I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better ""communicate"" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula.

Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change.

"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",really good choice nutritionally sound lower calorie food cat admittedly picky immediately devoured real message need find many kcal day cat need weight loss research calorie cat food accurately measure feeding appear industry standard labeled weight management light etc difference dramatic br br young energetic cat starting piling weight kitten maybe stuff rescue know whether might starvation early week marked life put adult food kitten year advice veterinarian went gain weight almost 20 lb even giving recommended daily amount food measured divided 2 daily feeding br br decided switch purina pro plan regular adult formula weight management formula still kitty gaining finally research many kcal day getting many kcal giving mind recommended measured amount shocked packaging recommends 56 84 g day food weight loss cat goal weight 10 14 lb 214 321 calorie measured nutrition information research showed recommended amount 187 calorie day weight loss goal weight 10 12 lb mean minimum amount recommended purina label 27 calorie day getting 14 maximum recommended amount 72 getting weight loss br br publication calorie count cup wide variety cat food br range calorie staggering anyone overweight cat cat favor research many calorie day getting many calorie recommended amount feeding actually br br finding much pro plan weight management per day offer thought problem started giving daily amount right calorie weight loss start losing slow safe rate 2 lb week constantly frantically hungry looked nutritionally sound food could give volume fill still exceeding calorie would need weight loss help nutritional rating calorie chart selected science diet light approximately 75 calorie per cup compared purina pro plan give 9g day think higher fiber content food help feel full cost previous food difference going break bank estimate cost 4 per month,NEGATIVE,0.9921767115592957,6,"['really good choice', 'lower calorie food cat', 'real message', 'need', 'many kcal day cat', 'weight loss research calorie cat food', 'industry standard', 'labeled weight management light etc difference', 'dramatic br br young energetic cat', 'weight kitten', 'stuff rescue', 'early week marked life', 'adult food', 'kitten year advice veterinarian', 'recommended daily amount food', '2 daily feeding br br', 'switch purina pro plan regular adult formula weight management formula', 'many kcal day', 'many kcal giving mind', 'measured amount shocked packaging', '56 84 g day food weight loss cat goal weight', 'measured nutrition information research', 'recommended amount', 'mean minimum amount', 'purina label', '14 maximum recommended amount', 'weight loss br br publication calorie count cup', 'wide variety cat food br range calorie', 'anyone overweight cat cat favor research', 'br', 'much pro plan weight management', 'day', 'daily amount', 'right calorie weight loss', 'slow safe rate', 'nutritionally sound food', 'volume fill', 'calorie', 'weight loss', 'nutritional rating calorie chart', 'science diet light', 'approximately 75 calorie', 'cup', 'purina pro plan', '9g day', 'higher fiber content food help', 'full cost previous food difference', 'break bank estimate', 'month']"

"This dry kibble was the third try in our quest to find a balanced kibble for our Bernese Moutnain Dog. There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking! Our BMD had ZERO gastric upset during transition and became energetic again. Nature's Variety has produced nearly half the stools, which are small compact and virtually odorless. He has NO gas and his coat is shiny and feels conditioned. People are noticing the change and we couldnt be happier.

"Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review.

"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.

"I saw these noodles at a local international food store.  I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.

"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.

"Folger's scores another coup with their awesome French Vanilla ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here.

It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />There's only one minor disappointment: the label says that this coffee contains ""added natural and artificial flavors.""

"What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology.

I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has ""purifying grains"", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars.

Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand ....
